                Virginia Data Analysis Tools and Website have been developed 
                for Virginia residents and employees. This application uses
                data from the Virginia Longitudinal Data System to make years of 
                captured data avaliable to the public. This data is from the
                public schools within the Commonwealth of Virginia.
                
                Our goal as an development team is to make this large data set
                provided by VLDS accessible to the public. Furthermore, we want 
                to provide you with accurate and useful information corresponding
                to Virginia's public schools system. 

                These tools within Virginia Data Analysis Website can help 
                residents of Virginia understand what our direction is as a whole.
                The tools provided will enable our residents to see achievements
                as well as failures within our system. Hence, helping our 
                residents become stronger advocates for helping our children 
                become stronger today for tomorrow!
